    <font size="5px"><p>Global Warming is a term almost everyone is familiar with. But, its meaning is still not clear to most of us. So,
        Global warming refers to the gradual rise in the overall temperature of the atmosphere of the Earth. There are
        various activities taking place which have been increasing the temperature gradually. Global warming is melting
        our ice glaciers rapidly. This is extremely harmful to the earth as well as humans. It is quite challenging to
        control global warming; however, it is not unmanageable. The first step in solving any problem is identifying
        the cause of the problem. Therefore, we need to first understand the causes of global warming that will help us
        proceed further in solving it. In this essay on Global Warming, we will see the causes and solutions of Global
        Warming.
        Global warming has become a grave problem which needs undivided attention. It is not happening because of a
        single cause but several causes. These causes are both natural as well as manmade. The natural causes include
        the release of greenhouses gases which are not able to escape from earth, causing the temperature to increase.

        Further, volcanic eruptions are also responsible for global warming. That is to say, these eruptions release
        tons of carbon dioxide which contributes to global warming. Similarly, methane is also one big issue responsible
        for global warming.
